                        Alienation?</strong><br>
                      Parental alienation is the process, and the result, of
                      psychological manipulation of a child into showing
                      unwarranted fear, disrespect or hostility towards a parent
                      and/or other family members. It is a distinctive form of
                      psychological abuse and family violence, towards both the
                      child and the rejected family members, that occurs almost
                      exclusively in association with family separation or
                      divorce, particularly where legal action is involved. The
                      most common cause is one parent wishing to exclude the
                      other parent from the life of their child<br>
