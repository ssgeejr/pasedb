# PASEDB
Parental Alienation Support &amp; Education Database

### Mission Statement
Provide a simple, centralized location to allow easy access to support and educational sites relating to Parental Alienation

### Site Location
The site resides at http://pasedb.org


### Comments
When America's court systems fail you, three options remain:  
1) Become a victim  
2) Quit and fade into oblivion   
3) Become a light and share what you have learned so other's do not have to carve the path on their own  
  
It should be obvious my choice. This site is dedicated to my three children whom I hope one day to see again.
