### Comments
```
When America's court systems fail you, when after committing no crime you lose everything you are presented with three options:  
1) Become a victim  
2) Quit and fade into oblivion   
3) Become a light for other and share what you have learned so other's do not have to carve a path of their own  
  
It should be obvious my choice. This site is didicated to my three children whom I hope one day to see again.
